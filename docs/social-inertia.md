1. Overcoming Social Inertia {#overcoming-social-inertia .chapter}
============================

@firstcopyingnotice{{Copyright © 2007, 2009 Richard Stallman\
 {This essay was originally published on <http://gnu.org>, in 2007. This
version is part of @fsfsthreecite} Almost two decades have passed since
the combination of GNU and Linux first made it possible to use a PC in
freedom. We have come a long way since then. Now you can even buy a
laptop with GNU/Linux preinstalled from more than one hardware
vendor—although the systems they ship are not entirely free software. So
what holds us back from total success?

The main obstacle to the triumph of software freedom is social inertia.
It exists in many forms, and you have surely seen some of them. Examples
include devices that only work on Windows and commercial web sites
accessible only with Windows. If you value short-term convenience
instead of freedom, you might consider these reason enough to use
Windows. Most companies currently run Windows, so students who think
short-term want to learn how to use it and ask their schools to teach
it. Schools teach Windows, produce graduates that are used to using
Windows, and this encourages businesses to use Windows.

Microsoft actively nurtures this inertia: it encourages schools to
inculcate dependency on Windows, and contracts to set up web sites that
then turn out to work only with Internet Explorer.

A few years ago, Microsoft ads argued that Windows was cheaper to run
than GNU/Linux. Their comparisons were debunked, but it is worth noting
the deeper flaw in their argument, the implicit premise which cites a
form of social inertia: “Currently, more technical people know Windows
than GNU/Linux.” People who value their freedom would not give it up to
save money, but many business executives believe ideologically that
everything they possess, even their freedom, should be for sale.

Social inertia consists of people who have given in to social inertia.
When you surrender to social inertia, you become part of the pressure it
exerts on others; when you resist it, you reduce it. We conquer social
inertia by identifying it, and resolving not to be part of it.

Here a weakness holds our community back: most GNU/Linux users have
never even heard the ideas of freedom that motivated the development of
GNU, so they still judge matters based on short-term convenience rather
than on their freedom. This makes them vulnerable to being led by the
nose by social inertia, so that they become part of the inertia.

To build our community’s strength to resist, we need to talk about free
software and freedom—not merely about the practical benefits that open
source supporters cite. As more people recognize what they need to do to
overcome the inertia, we will make more progress.
