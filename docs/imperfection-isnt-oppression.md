1. Imperfection Is Not the Same as Oppression {#imperfection-is-not-the-same-as-oppression .chapter}

When a free program lacks capabilities that users want, that is
unfortunate; we urge people to add what is missing. Some would go
further and claim that a program is not even free software if it lacks
certain functionality—that it denies freedom 0 (the freedom to run the
program as you wish) to users or uses that it does not support. This
argument is misguided because it is based on identifying capacity with
freedom, and imperfection with oppression.

Each program inevitably has certain functionalities and lacks others
that might be desirable. There are some jobs it can do, and others it
can’t do without further work. This is the nature of software.

The absence of key functionality can mean certain users find the program
totally unusable. For instance, if you only understand graphical
interfaces, a command line program may be impossible for you to use. If
you can’t see the screen, a program without a screen reader may be
impossible for you to use. If you speak only Greek, a program with menus
and messages in English may be impossible for you to use. If your
programs are written in Ada, a C compiler is impossible for you to use.
To overcome these barriers yourself is unreasonable to demand of you.
Free software really ought to provide the functionality you need.

Free software really ought to provide it, but the lack of that feature
does not make the program nonfree, because it is an imperfection, not
oppression.

Making a program nonfree is an injustice committed by the developer that
denies freedom to whoever uses it. The developer deserves condemnation
for this. It is crucial to condemn that developer, because nobody else
can undo the injustice as long as the developer continues to do it. We
can, and do, try to rescue the victims by developing a free replacement,
but we can’t make the nonfree program free.

Developing a free program without adding a certain important feature is
not doing wrong to anyone. Rather, it’s doing some good but not all the
good that people need. Nobody in particular deserves condemnation for
not developing the missing feature, since any capable person could do
it. It would be ungrateful, as well as self-defeating, to single out the
free program’s authors for blame for not having done some additional
work.

What we can do is state that completing the job calls for doing some
additional work. That is constructive because it helps us convince
someone to do that work.

If you think a certain extension in a free program is important, please
push for it in the way that respects our contributors. Don’t criticize
the people who contributed the useful code we have. Rather, look for a
way to complete the job. You can urge the program’s developers to turn
their attention to the missing feature when they have time for more
work. You can offer to help them. You can recruit people or raise funds
to support the work.
