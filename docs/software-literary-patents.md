1. Software Patents and Literary Patents {#software-patents-and-literary-patents .chapter}
========================================

 {This essay was originally published on <http://guardian.co.uk>, on
23 June 2005. It was then titled “Patent Absurdity” and focused on the
proposed European software patent directive. This version is part of
@fsfsthreecite} When politicians consider the question of software
patents, they are usually voting blind; not being programmers, they
don’t understand what software patents really do. They often think
patents are similar to copyright law (“except for some details”)—which
is not the case. For instance, when I publicly asked Patrick Devedjian,
then Minister for Industry in France, how France would vote on the issue
of software patents, Devedjian responded with an impassioned defense of
copyright law, praising Victor Hugo for his role in the adoption of
copyright. (The misleading term “intellectual property” promotes this
confusion—one of the reasons it should never be used.)

Those who imagine effects like those of copyright law cannot grasp the
disastrous effects of software patents. We can use Victor Hugo as an
example to illustrate the difference.

A novel and a modern complex program have certain points in common: each
one is large, and implements many ideas in combination. So let’s follow
the analogy, and suppose that patent law had been applied to novels in
the 1800s; suppose that states such as France had permitted the
patenting of literary ideas. How would this have affected Victor Hugo’s
writing? How would the effects of literary patents compare with the
effects of literary copyright?

Consider Victor Hugo’s novel Les Misérables. Since he wrote it, the
copyright belonged only to him. He did not have to fear that some
stranger could sue him for copyright infringement and win. That was
impossible, because copyright covers only the details of a work of
authorship, not the ideas embodied in them, and it only restricts
copying. Hugo had not copied Les Misérables, so he was not in danger
from copyright.

Patents work differently. Patents cover ideas; each patent is a monopoly
on practicing some idea, which is described in the patent itself. Here’s
one example of a hypothetical literary patent:

-   Claim 1: a communication process that represents in the mind of a
    reader the concept of a character who has been in jail for a long
    time and becomes bitter towards society and humankind.
-   Claim 2: a communication process according to claim 1, wherein said
    character subsequently finds moral redemption through the kindness
    of another.
-   Claim 3: a communication process according to claims 1 and 2,
    wherein said character changes his name during the story.

If such a patent had existed in 1862 when Les Misérables was published,
the novel would have conflicted with all three claims, since all these
things happened to Jean Valjean in the novel. Victor Hugo could have
been sued, and if sued, he would have lost. The novel could have been
prohibited—in effect, censored—by the patent holder.

Now consider this hypothetical literary patent:

-   Claim 1: a communication process that represents in the mind of a
    reader the concept of a character who has been in jail for a long
    time and subsequently changes his name.

Les Misérables would have been prohibited by that patent too, because
this description too fits the life story of Jean Valjean. And here’s
another hypothetical patent:

-   Claim 1: a communication process that represents in the mind of a
    reader the concept of a character who finds moral redemption and
    then changes his name.

Jean Valjean would have been forbidden by this patent too.

All three patents would cover, and prohibit, the life story of this one
character. They overlap, but they do not precisely duplicate each other,
so they could all be valid simultaneously; all three patent holders
could have sued Victor Hugo. Any one of them could have prohibited
publication of Les Misérables.

This patent also could have been violated:

-   Claim 1: a communication process that presents a character whose
    given name matches the last syllable of his family name.

through the name “Jean Valjean,” but at least this patent would have
been easy to avoid.

You might think that these ideas are so simple that no patent office
would have issued them. We programmers are often amazed by the
simplicity of the ideas that real software patents cover—for instance,
the European Patent Office has issued a patent on the progress bar, and
a patent on accepting payment via credit cards. These patents would be
laughable if they were not so dangerous.

Other aspects of Les Misérables could also have run afoul of patents.
For instance, there could have been a patent on a fictionalized
portrayal of the Battle of Waterloo, or a patent on using Parisian slang
in fiction. Two more lawsuits. In fact, there is no limit to the number
of different patents that might have been applicable for suing the
author of a work such as Les Misérables. All the patent holders would
say they deserved a reward for the literary progress that their patented
ideas represent, but these obstacles would not promote progress in
literature, they would only obstruct it.

However, a very broad patent could have made all these issues
irrelevant. Imagine a patent with broad claims like these:

-   A communication process structured with narration that continues
    through many pages.
-   A narration structure sometimes resembling a fugue or improvisation.
-   Intrigue articulated around the confrontation of specific
    characters, each in turn setting traps for the others.
-   Narration that presents many layers of society.
-   Narration that shows the wheels of hidden conspiracy.

Who would the patent holders have been? They could have been other
novelists, perhaps Dumas or Balzac, who had written such novels—but not
necessarily. It isn’t required to write a program to patent a software
idea, so if our hypothetical literary patents follow the real patent
system, these patent holders would not have had to write novels, or
stories, or anything—except patent applications. Patent parasite
companies, businesses that produce nothing except threats and lawsuits,
are booming nowadays.

Given these broad patents, Victor Hugo would not have reached the point
of asking what patents might get him sued for using the character of
Jean Valjean, because he could not even have considered writing a novel
of this kind.

This analogy can help nonprogrammers see what software patents do.
Software patents cover features, such as defining abbreviations in a
word processor, or natural order recalculation in a spreadsheet. Patents
cover algorithms that programs need to use. Patents cover aspects of
file formats, such as Microsoft’s OOXML format. MPEG 2 video format is
covered by 39 different US patents.

Just as one novel could run afoul of many different literary patents at
once, one program can be prohibited by many different patents at once.
It is so much work to identify all the patents that appear to apply to a
large program that only one such study has been done. A 2004 study of
Linux, the kernel of the GNU/Linux operating system, found 283 different
US software patents that seemed to cover it. That is to say, each of
these 283 different patents forbids some computational process found
somewhere in the thousands of pages of source code of Linux. At the
time, Linux was around 1 percent of the whole GNU/Linux system. How many
patents might there be that a distributor of the whole system could be
sued under?

The way to prevent software patents from bollixing software development
is simple: don’t authorize them. This ought to be easy, since most
patent laws have provisions against software patents. They typically say
that “software per se” cannot be patented. But patent offices around the
world are trying to twist the words and issuing patents on the ideas
implemented in programs. Unless this is blocked, the result will be to
put all software developers in danger.
